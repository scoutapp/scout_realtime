  <h1>Computers have changed a bit since 1984. Shouldn't <code>top</code> change too?</h1>
  <h2>Here’s what we’ve updated:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Smooth-scrolling, every-second updating charts.
      <div class="quiet">Trends become clear with the historical context of timeseries charts.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      See disk and network activity.
      <div class="quiet">While cpu and memory metrics are displayed via <code>top</code>, no disk or network metrics 
        are shown. We've added disk utilization, disk space, and network traffic. Now all of the key performance metrics
        are in a single view.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Clearer memory usage metrics.
      <div class="quiet">
        <code>top</code>'s <code>memory used</code> metric is the cause of <a href="http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2010/10/06/determining-free-memory-on-linux">frequent confusion</a>. It's usually very close to the total memory which makes it look like you are running of out RAM. However, that's not the case: Linux uses all free RAM for the disk buffer cache to make reading data from the disk as efficient as possible. We've removed the buffer cache from the memory numbers.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Grouping processes by name.
      <div class="quiet">
        The <code>top</code> display can jump around a lot as processes become active. We've grouped processes with the same 
        name together and display the number of processes running. The result? Trends in active processes become much clearer.

  <h1>Questions</h1>
  
  <h3>Is <code>scout_realtime</code> free?</h3>
  
  Yes - and open-source too! View the <a href="https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_realtime">source on Github</a>.
    <code>scout_realtime</code> is maintained by the team at <a href="https://scoutapp.com">Scout</a>, a SaaS server monitoring solution trusted by tens of thousands of developers.
  
  <h3>Is <code>scout_realtime</code> secure?</h3>
  
The daemon fetches key metrics from you server, stores them in memory, and renders them in your browser - there is no inbound communication and nothing is written to disk. We run it on our own production servers. 

  <h3>What operating systems are supported?</h3>
  
  <code>scout_realtime</code> relies heavily on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs">proc file system</a> to fetch
  metrics. procfs is available on Linux-based distributions. OSX and
  FreeBSD do not have full support for procfs and are not supported.
  
  <h3>What version of Ruby is required?</h3>
  
  You need Ruby 1.9.3+ on your server to run <code>scout_realtime</code>.
  
  <h3>Does my server need to have a public IP or domain name?</h3> 
  Yes, you need a public IP or domain name to view <code>scout_realtime</code> in your browser.

  <h3>Can multiple people view the realtime stats?</h3>
  Yes. Open a port in your firewall instead of using the SSH tunnel:
  <br><div class="terminal">sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5555 -j ACCEPT</div>

  <h3>The SSH tunnel is a pain. Is there a way to set up persistent access?</h3>
  Yes, just open a port in your firewall using the iptables command above.

  <h3>Can I specify a different port to run it on?</h3>
  Yes. <div class="terminal">scout_realtime --help</div> for options.

  <h3>Can I specify where the the log and/or PID is written?</h3>
  Yes. <div class="terminal">scout_realtime --help</div> for options.

  <h3>How much CPU and memory will this consume if I leave it running?</h3>
  We've clocked the CPU usage of the <code>scout_realtime</code> daemon at 1% on an Intel Xeon 2.40GHz CPU. Memory usage is around 22 MB.
  If you turn off the metric collection (by
  clicking the pause button on the web page), CPU usage will effectively drop to 0%, and you'll still be able to visit the web page and
  re-enable metrics at any time.

  <h3>Installing the gem didn't work.</h3>
  You need Ruby 1.9.3+ on your server to run <code>scout_realtime</code>.
  Try <div class="terminal">which ruby</div> (to confirm you have Ruby), <div class="terminal">ruby -v</div> (to show Ruby's version), and
  <div class="terminal">which gem</div> to confirm you have Ruby gems (Ruby's package manager) available.

  <h3>Where's the log file?</h3>
  By default, the a log is written to <code>~/.scout/scout_realtime.log</code>

  <h3>How do I stop the daemon?</h3>

  <p><div class="terminal">scout_realtime stop</div></p>
  
  <h3>How do I uninstall <code>scout_realtime</code>?</h3>

  <p><div class="terminal">gem uninstall scout_realtime</div></p><!-- questions_inner -->
